0x07 - Recursion


Playing recursive functions! Calling the function inside itself, mainly to do arithmetic without using loops.


0-puts_recursion.c
a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.


1-print_rev_recursion.c
a function that prints a string in reverse.


2-strlen_recursion.c
a function that returns the length of a string.


3-factorial.c
a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error.
Factorial of 0 is 1.


4-pow_recursion.c
a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1.


5-sqrt_recursion.c
a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.


6-is_prime_number.c
a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.


is_palindrome.c
a function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
An empty string is a palindrome


wildcmp.c
a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.
s2 can contain the special character \*.
The special char * can replace any string (including an empty string).
